## Comparing OpenMP and OpenCL

A simple work comparing the parallel computation models OpenMP and OpenCL.

#### Benchmark: 6 applications chosen from Rodinia Benchmark Suite.
- Back-propagation
- Breadth-First-Search
- k-Means
- LU Decomposition
- Particle Filter
- PathFinder

#### Metrics:
1. Ease of programming:
    - Lines of Code (LOC)
    - Number of Character (NOC)
    - Number of parameters/function calls/types
2. Performance:
    - Execution time/efficiency
    - Speed-up
    - Memory taken*
